# react-native-proxy
React Native performance improver made easy :)

### What's it?
It's a Proxy component to react-native to improve apps performance.  

### When to use?
Use it to improve app or components performance.

### How works?
It creates a proxy around the view component. The component starts loading lazily, instead eager, when app starts or component loads. Combine with libs and components like react-navigation, react-native components, etc.

### How to use?
